# Capestone--Business-Intelligence-Presentation-Proposal

Introduction
In today's data-driven business environment, business Intelligence (BI) is critical for converting raw data into actionable insights. This proposal provides a presentation on data cleaning and visualization with electric vehicle (EV) data, with an emphasis on the extraction phase of the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) framework.

Presentation Candidate
I am Nitin Narayan Gurav, a mechanical engineering graduate with experience as a database administrator at Tata Consultancy Services for a year. 

Data Selection
Criteria for Choosing the Dataset:
The dataset "Full Electric Vehicle Dataset 2024" from Kaggle was chosen because to its relevance to current environmental issues and the global deployment of electric vehicles. It provides a wealth of data for research and visualization, allowing for in-depth investigation of EV usage trends, charging behaviours, and more.

Relevance of Selected Data to the Business Domain:
The automobile industry is seeing a huge shift toward electric cars, driven by environmental restrictions and customer demand for sustainable mobility alternatives. Understanding EV data is critical for automakers, governments, and stakeholders in developing successful strategies, improving infrastructure, and meeting sustainability targets.

Business Intelligence Techniques Demonstration
An overview of selected business intelligence techniques:
  Data cleaning: it include removing discrepancies, addressing missing values, and guaranteeing data integrity.
  Data visualization: it is the process of creating useful and visually appealing charts, graphs, and dashboards to effectively communicate findings.
  Descriptive analytics: it involves analyzing past EV data to detect trends, patterns, and anomalies.

Process of Applying These Techniques to the Selected Data:
  Data Cleaning: Use ETL and SQL Data Modelling approaches to preprocess raw EV data.
  Data Visualization: Use Desktop Reporting and Dashboards/Visualizations to build dynamic and useful visual displays.
  Descriptive Analytics: Use data wrangling and Python data modelling to derive useful insights from cleansed data.

Anticipated Insights and Their Impact on Business Strategies:
  Understanding peak charging times and locations to optimize EV charging infrastructure.
  Identifying factors influencing EV adoption rates for targeted marketing and policy interventions.
  Predicting future EV demand to inform production planning and inventory management.

Implementation Plan
Schedule for Development of the Presentation:
  Data Acquisition and Cleaning: Week 1
  Data Visualization and Analysis: Week 2
  Presentation Preparation and Rehearsals: Week 3

Necessary Resources:
  BI Tools: Power BI, or similar visualization platforms.
  Datasets: Kaggle dataset on Full Electric Vehicle Dataset 2024.
  Programming Languages: Python for data analysis and modeling.

Conclusion
This BI presentation will demonstrate the  transformative potential of data-driven insights in the context of electric vehicle data. Using advanced analytics and visualization tools, stakeholders may make educated decisions to foster long-term growth and innovation in the automobile sector.
